## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Discover South Wales is a website designed for potential first time visitors with limited knowledge of rural areas to explore. It's a simple design, centered round a short quiz, and it aims to give users a quick guide on where to go. By asking a set of 5 questions based on what the user’s preferences are, the website acts as a personal guide, presenting one of eleven locations based on the user's results, that would be well suited to the answers the user gives.

There is an additional Map page, which gives the user an overall view of the suggested locations within South Wales. This also allows the user to explore more options if they are not satisfied with the recommendation from taking the quiz.

#### Key Information for the site

- A user friendly quiz with a set of 5 simple questions with 3 possible answers each, to determine where may be a good place to visit whilst in South Wales.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Small switch palette from ColorSpace](docs/images/small-switch-palette.png)

Discover South Wales uses this small switch palette, pulled from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23096A2E&sub=1), and generated from #096A2E, pulled from the logo colour chart below.

![Logo color chart from Logo.com](docs/images/logo-colour-chart.png)

I picked this colour scheme as it went with the colour theme of my customized logo, and has strong connotations to the rural outdoors; keeping in theme with websites function.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following font:

- 'Lato' for all text content across the website. This is a sans serif font.
I picked this particular font as it was suggested on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/#:~:text=Josefin%20Sans%20is%20an%20elegant>,One%2C%20Lato%2C%20and%20Playfair). The website states that 'Lato' would pair nicely with Josefins sans font, which is the primary font used for the logo on the home page. I wanted to keep it simple and consistent throughout the website, so opted for one style only to portray this.

### Imagery

All digital images in the results section, (excluding two images referenced in the [credit](#credits) section), were taken by Clara Reynolds.
The [Seamless Pattern Leaves](assets/images/background-print-image-compressed.webp) for the left and right border across all pages, and the [Hiking Trail Sketch](assets/images/background-hiking.webp) featured in the 404 error page, were both downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).
