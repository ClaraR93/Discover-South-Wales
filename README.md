## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Discover South Wales is a website designed for potential first time visitors with limited knowledge of rural areas to explore. It's a simple design, centered round a short quiz, and it aims to give users a quick guide on where to go. By asking a set of 5 questions based on what the userâ€™s preferences are, the website acts as a personal guide, presenting one of eleven locations based on the user's results, that would be well suited to the answers the user gives.

There is an additional Map page, which gives the user an overall view of the suggested locations within South Wales. This also allows the user to explore more options if they are not satisfied with the recommendation from taking the quiz.

#### Key Information for the site

- A user friendly quiz with a set of 5 simple questions with 3 possible answers each, to determine where may be a good place to visit whilst in South Wales.
- An interactive map, allowing the user to select other locations of their choice in the area.
