## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

Discover South Wales is a website designed for potential first time visitors with limited knowledge of rural areas to explore. It's a simple design, centered round a short quiz, and it aims to give users a quick guide on where to go. By asking a set of 5 questions based on what the user's preferences are, the website acts as a personal guide, presenting one of eleven locations based on the user's results, that would be well suited to the answers the user gives.

There is an additional Map page, which gives the user an overall view of the suggested locations within South Wales. This also allows the user to explore more options if they are not satisfied with the recommendation from taking the quiz.

#### Key Information for the site

- A user friendly quiz with a set of 5 simple questions with 3 possible answers each, to determine where may be a good place to visit whilst in South Wales.
- An interactive map, allowing the user to select other locations of their choice in the area.
- An external link to an instagram page within the footer, encouraging users to share places they have been and follow the website's instagram page.

### User Stories

#### Client Goals

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To provide a simple start up guide for first time visitors in South Wales, encouraging users to explore suggested locations based on their quiz answers.
- To encourage users to share their stories and connect on the websites' instagram page, with an aim to increase website traffic and encourage tourism in South Wales.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- I want to visit South Wales for the first time and don't know where to start looking.
- I want to be able to find other places to explore in South Wales if I want more recommendations.
- I want to be able to access additional information on the locations offered.
- I want to be able to navigate through the website with ease and efficiency.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- I want to be able to share my experiences with other users by following the website's Instagram page.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

- I want to be able to see other recommendations pop up from time to time, so that I can continue exploring South Wales and share this with others.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Small switch palette from ColorSpace](docs/images/small-switch-palette.png)

Discover South Wales uses this small switch palette, pulled from [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23096A2E&sub=1), and generated from #096A2E, pulled from the logo colour chart below.

![Logo color chart from Logo.com](docs/images/logo-colour-chart.png)

I picked this colour scheme as it went with the colour theme of my customized logo, and has strong connotations to the rural outdoors; keeping in theme with websites function.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts for the following font:

- 'Lato' for all text content across the website. This is a sans serif font.
I picked this particular font as it was suggested on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/josefin-sans-font-pairings/#:~:text=Josefin%20Sans%20is%20an%20elegant>,One%2C%20Lato%2C%20and%20Playfair). The website states that 'Lato' would pair nicely with Josefins sans font, which is the primary font used for the logo on the home page. I wanted to keep it simple and consistent throughout the website, so opted for one style only to portray this.

### Imagery

All digital images in the results section, (excluding two images referenced in the [credit](#media) section), were taken by Clara Reynolds.
The [Seamless Pattern Leaves](assets/images/background-print-image-compressed.webp) for the left and right border across all pages, and the [Hiking Trail Sketch](assets/images/background-hiking.webp) featured in the 404 error page, were both downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). Content License allows users to use content for free and modify or adapt the content into new works.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop.

[Map Page - Desktop](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_desktop_.png) |
[Map Page - Tablet](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_tablet_.png) |
[Map Page - Mobile](docs/wireframes/maps/maps_mobile_.png)

The final website design has maintained the simple structure as shown in the wireframes, with a few minor changes here and there. I wanted to keep the design quite minimalistic as I wanted to focus more on implementing javascript code to the Quiz and Map page.

### Features

The website consists of three pages, all of which are accessible from the navigation menu throughout the website. A custom 404 error page is also available if a user were to land on it.

*All pages on the website have:*

- A responsive navigation bar and navigation links across the header from left to right as followed - Home, Quiz, Map. On a mobile device, the navigation bar switches to a dropdown menu, taken from [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/dropdowns/), so that it is easier to view and navigate on a smaller screen.
- When hovered over, each navigation link will change colour from black to a cream colour (used from the [small switch palette](docs/images/small-switch-palette.png)), to show what page the user is about to navigate to.
- The footer consists of a headline encouraging users to connect with the website's Instagram page, followed by a font awesome icon underneath of the recognisable Instagram logo. When the icon is clicked on, this opens up in a separate browser to www.instgram.com. When hovered over, this link displays the beige colour again, keeping in theme with the small switch palette. There is copyright centered beneath the icon in a small font size.
- Both header and footer contain a natural green/brown colour, pulled from the small switch palette as well.

*Home Page:*

- The home page is a simple and elegant design, featuring a logo that I custom created on [Logo.com](https://logo.com/). The logo image includes a green silhouette of two trees inside a white silhouette of mountain tops, inside a matching green circle. Underneath this a slogan that reads “Discover South Wales” in green, with a tag-line of “Unveiling Nature's Treasures” directly below this. The logo is scaled down to fit mobile devices as well.
- Underneath the logo are two heading titles with the questions “Visiting South Wales for the first time?” and “Ready to start exploring the great outdoors?”. These two headings are short and simple, designed to address the users needs of venturing to the area for the first time.
- Below this I've added a simple div containing a discrete line that splits the page into 2 sections; the heading and quiz information.
The quiz heading instructs  the user to take a short quiz on where to go. This is accompanied with a clear 'Start Quiz' button that navigates the user to the Quiz page. When hovered over the button creates a smooth transition from a green background to a mixture of green and brown, keeping in theme with the colour of the header and footer.

*Quiz Page:*

- When the user navigates to the quiz page they are greeted with the first question with instructions to select one of 3 answers below. When the answers are hovered over by the user the background colour disappears, and when the user selects an answer, it is highlighted in the green/brown mixture, indicating that this has been selected. This was put in place instead of radio buttons, so the user has a greater range to click on, rather than just aiming for a small radio button. A user may click between answers before deciding to move onto the next question. If a user doesn't select an answer and selects the 'next' button, an alert pops up urging the user to select an answer.
- When the next button is hovered over, this too changes to a green/brown colour signifying to the user to click next.
- Over the next set of questions, the initial instructions are removed. At the last question the user is greeted with a submit button, styled in the same way as the next button.
- When the user submits their answers, the quiz questions are replaced all together with one of eleven possible results. These results are structured in the following order:
  - A title featuring “Based on your recommendations, we recommend…”
  - Place name title
  - A brief description of what to expect
  - An accompanying image of the location
  - A link that opens up an external website in a separate window, giving the user more in depth detail about the hike and navigation. When the link is hovered over the background colour changes to white.
- Beneath the results there are two short, but informative headlines. These signify to the user that if they're not happy with their recommended result they can navigate over to the maps page to explore more options. The navigation link is represented by a font awesome icon of a map/marker, which when hovered over changes from green to green/brown.
- This is separated by a line divider, and underneath this there is an option for the user to start the quiz over if they wish to do so. This is represented in the familiar button style marked as 'Start over', keeping in theme with the rest of the website. By clicking this button, the user is taken to the first mutliple choice question again.

*Map Page:*

- The Map page can be accessed via the navigation link Map, or the font awesome map icon when the user receives their recommended results on the quiz page.
- This page features Google Maps, centered on South Wales with eleven markers numbered 1 - 11. Each marker, when clicked on once will display the name of the marker's location. When double clicked, this also takes the user to an external website in a separate window, with more details on the location. The user is able to zoom in and out, and move around the maps, to explore each marker available.
- If, due to poor internet connection, the maps are loading slowly, I've implemented simple loading dots just below the navigation bar, to indicate to the user that the maps are loading.
- Above the Google Maps are simple instructions, represented with an 'information' font awesome icon ('i'), telling the user to “Click the map markers to view place names, and double click them for more information”. This gives the user clarity on how to navigate through Google Maps.

*404 Error Page:*

- The 404 page Features a print of a figure walking through the hills with a couple of trees. This image is sandwiched between two informative headings reassuring the user that they can navigate back to the home page (featured at the bottom), to continue using the website.

*Future Implementations:*

- Future goals include creating an Instagram page that allows users to share images of where they have been, tagging @DiscoverSouthWales or #DiscoverSouthWales, for a chance to get their photo featured on the official Instagram page. This will encourage new users to stumble across the Instagram page, in turn leading them to this website to participate in the quiz.
- I want to add more place results, and potentially replace old ones, so that returning users can continue exploring other places to go. In order to decide which places are to be replaced, I would collect the quiz results data and determine which results were coming up the least, replacing these with new suggestions.
- I want to be able to extend the quiz, asking further questions, so that the user gets an even more specified result, tailoring to their outdoor wants and desires.

### Accessibility

I have ensure that this website is as accessible friendly as possible, I have done the following to achieve this:

- Used semantic HTML.
- Used visually hidden text to describe background images in CSS, where an alt attribute cannot be supplied.
- Included aria-label for website navigation to describe to the screen reader where the user is being taken to.
- Used alt attributes to images in HTML to describe them.
- Using the [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) colour contrast checker to ensure all body text is legible with sufficient contrast.

## Testing

Testing was implemented throughout the entire build of this project. I used Chrome Developer tools to identify and troubleshoot problems along the way.

*The following issues were identified during my mid mentor meeting:*

*The following suggestions were recommended when I showed a friend the site for review:*

- Tom Roberts informed me that once a user lands on the submit page, the following text should be a more obvious button that takes the user to the maps page, rather than just a small map icon. See image: ![Quiz answers, further suggestions, old version](docs/images/further-suggestions-old.png)
- Tom also suggested that this page should include an additional button which gives the user the option to navigate back to the home page to restart the quiz if they want to. Final result with peer review implemented:
![Quiz answers with peer suggestions implemented](docs/images/further-suggestions-new.png)

*The following suggestions were recommended when I submitted my site to peer code review on slack:*

### W3C Validator

I used W3C HTML Validator on all pages created, and W3C CSS Validator on CSS content.

### JSHint

I used JShint on all javascript content.

### Solved Bugs

**Logic of interactive quiz:**

- When drafting up the quiz logic prior to coding, I  assigned each multiple choice answer to one of 11 possible results at the end for the user. This resulted in a very unique set of answers tailored to each result, which would restrict the quiz; given that a user would have to match their answers perfectly to a specific result. This would limit the user experience as it would be likely that based on their input, they wouldn't always get an exact match.
- Instead I opted for a simpler quiz logic where I graded each multiple choice answer from 1-3. With 5 questions and 3 answers for each, these points would generate any number between 5 and 15. Based on this, I assigned each number to one of 11 results tailored to the user's input.
As a result, it was easier to visualise how I would create a function that would calculate the score, i.e: By taking the final sum of the user's 5 answers, and returning a given result.

*Draft plan of function before implemented in code:*

- 5 questions | 3 answers | Value assigned to each answer:
  - Answer A = 1 point
  - Answer B = 2 points
  - Answer C = 3 points

Possible user score | Assigned Result
---|---
5 | 1
6 | 2
7 | 3
8 | 4
9 | 5
10 | 6
11 | 7
12 | 8
13 | 9
14 | 10
15 | 11

**Radio Input buttons:**

- When testing the radio buttons for the multiple choice questions, the user was able to select all three buttons, which was not my expected result. I did some research on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5419459/how-to-allow-only-one-radio-button-to-be-checked), and found that I had given individual names to each input, when I should have grouped these under one name. After amending this the radio buttons worked as intended, allowing one selection at a time.

**Radio Input Checked:**

- I wanted to get the radio button element from the html file in its checked state to create an if else statement, ensuring a user is prompted to click on the radio button if they hit next without selecting anything. [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1423777/how-can-i-check-whether-a-radio-button-is-selected-with-javascript) helped me here, as I wasn’t sure how to select a radio input that had been checked.

![Checked radio button selection](docs/images/radio-button-checked.png)

**Clear radio function - part 1:**

- I noticed when I ran through the quiz the radio button always remained checked on the last users input. I wanted to ensure the radio buttons were cleared every time a user started a new question. I used code from [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-uncheck-a-radio-button-using-javascript-jquery#:~:text=In%20the%20clearRadio()%20function,to%20uncheck%20the%20radio%20button) to assist me with this.
- Within this code I made sure to assign the checked radio button with a false boolean, which would be called as an event listener after the user hits the next button.

**Clear radio button function - Part 2**

- After creating the clearRadio function to ensure the radio button was deselected for the next question in the quiz, I encountered a problem where the function wasn't working, despite using code from Tutorials Point as stated in the last problem.
- I realized that this was because I wasn't iterating through each question so that the radio buttons were always unchecked, so I used the forEach method to iterate through each question, ensuring that the radio buttons were always unchecked to start off with.

![clearRadio function with forEach method](docs/images/clear-radio-function.png)

**Problem with logging multiple array answers:**

- I ran a test anticipating what would happen if a user changed their mind and selected a diff radio button before moving onto the next question. Unfortunately this resulted in all user selections being pushed into an empty userAnswers array. This would result in more values being pushed into the array, which would lead to incorrect or non-existent results at the end of the quiz.
- I resolved this by adding an event listener for the next and submit button, to restrict users' selections to only being logged once they clicked these buttons. I did this by calling the validateUserInput function in the event listener when clicked, which would then call the storeUserAnswers function, logging the user input into the userAnswers array.
- See image of final console log below- including a calculateScore function implemented at the end with a total sum of the userAnswers array.

![Console log of userAnswers array and calculateScore funtion](docs/images/console-log-userAnswers.png)

**Quiz flow error before submission:**

- When testing what would happen if a user didn't click the submit button and the alert was flagged up, I noticed that once the user clicked off the alert the code below would be triggered anyway and the user would be presented with the results display before they even had a chance to select the final radio button.

![Quiz flow error code](docs/images/quiz-flow-error.png)

- To rectify this, I encompassed the previous code in an if statement so that the classList.add events were only triggered once a user selected their final radio button.

![Quiz flow fixed](docs/images/quiz-flow-ammended.png)

- To tidy this code up further, I created a separate function called hideQuiz and called this within an event listener when a user clicks on the submit button. See final code of hideQuiz function:

![hideQuiz function](docs/images/hide-quiz-function.png)

**Replacing if else statement with math.min/math.max method:**

- When drafting up the logic for how the quiz results would be generated, I initially decided to go with an if else statement, whereby if the final results were equal to 5 this would produce the first answer, else if they were equal to 6 it would produce the second answer, and so on.
- I found that this would result in a very lengthy if else statement and wanted to come up with something simpler and cleaner. I started by googling how to convert a range of numbers, as I had a set of 11 answers ranging from a score point of 5 to 15. I wanted to convert these points to an index from 0 through to 10, making it easier to iterate through the object answers array and assign their given calculated score.
- For this I used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5842747/how-can-i-use-javascript-to-limit-a-number-between-a-min-max-value), which suggested using the math.min and math.max method in javascript to achieve this. I passed the score in, making sure to take away 5, creating the minimum index of 0 and setting the maximum number to 10. This would give me 11 indexes which I could assign to the 11 possible results generated.

![math.min and math.max method used on answerIndex](docs/images/answerIndex-converted.png)

**Misplacement of alt image display:**

![Misplacement of alt image under quiz questions](docs/images/image-display-issue-screenshot.png)

- In the image above, the icon with the placeholder alt tag was showing below the next button during the quiz, even though the quiz answers title and description were displayed once the showResults function was called. I quickly fixed this by setting the answer-image div display to none initially, and setting it back to block within the showResults function.

**Clicking on map markers in mobile responsive design:**

![Map marker when hovered over](docs/images/map-markers.png)

- Originally, when a user was to hover over a map marker, the place name would pop up, and when clicked on, the user would navigate to a separate web page with additional information. I tested this on my mobile phone too, and noticed that a user was unable to hover over the map markers to view the info window displaying the place name. Instead, they were limited to clicking on any one of the markers leading them to an external website.
- This would result in a poor user experience as the user wouldn't know which marker they were clicking on without the aid of an information window, before deciding to open up a new tab.
- To ensure this was compatible on mobile devices as well, I altered the event listeners by having a user click on a marker to view their name, and then double click on this to view an external tab with more information. Additionally, I placed some brief instructions above the map, to make it clear on how to navigate through this. See image below:

![Map marker instructions](docs/images/map-page.png)

**Quiz container style:**

- I wasn't happy with the div container boxes storing the quiz questions and answer results, and wanted to style these differently.
  
![Old design of quiz containers](docs/images/quiz-container-old-design.png)

- The original design above felt too garish, almost stealing the spotlight from the quiz content.
I considered using a box shadow effect instead, and used [Design Shack](https://designshack.net/articles/css/inner-shadows-in-css-images-text-and-beyond/) to assist me with its placement. The results achieved were far more stylish and elegant, and gracefully complemented the foreground quiz content.

![New design of quiz contianers](docs/images/quiz-container-design-new.png)

**Contrast fail:**

![Failed contrast checker for header and footer](docs/images/contrast-checker-fail.png)

- In the above image, the contrast in header and footer wasn't strong enough for lighter weight font, so I tried changing the font colours to something lighter, such as beige or white to match with a consistent colour theme. Unfortunately this didn't pass the contrast checker either, so I went on [color-hex](https://www.color-hex.com/color/79804f) and found a lighter tint of the original background colour and replaced it with [#939972](https://www.color-hex.com/color/939972).
- This passed the contrast checker test, also meaning I could keep in theme with the colour palette, only dropping a couple of tint's lighter for better legibility. See passed contrast checker below:
  
![Passed contrast checker for header and footer](docs/images/contrast-checker-pass.png)

**Quiz answer layout:**

- In my original wireframe design as shown below, I included a location pin of the tailored result.

![Wireframe of quiz answers](docs/wireframes/quiz/quiz_answers_desktop_.png)

- I decided not to include this in my final design as it would have appeared too cluttered, and given that there was already a page for maps, with a direct link below the results, I didn't see the need to include both. See final design below:
  
![Final design for quiz answers](docs/images/quiz-answers-final.png)

**JSHint warnings**

- When I ran my Javascript code through JSHint, several warnings cropped up, depicting the following below:

![JSHint warnings in maps.js](docs/images/jshint-warnings.png)

- I researched online how to rectify this, and came across [Github's](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/3324) issue resolved on the same problem. I followed one of their suggested solutions; letting JSHint know that I am using ES2015 syntax in my project. By adding an inline directive at the top of my source code file: /*jshint esversion: 2015*/ , this removed all the warnings within my code.

**W3C HTML Validator issues:**

- I came across the following issues when running the quiz.html code through it:

![W3C HTML Validator empty source issue](docs/w3c/w3c-html-empty-src-issue.png)

- I researched this issue and came across [Stack Overflow's](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30658663/bad-value-for-attribute-src-on-element-img-must-be-non-empty-for-dynamically) suggested solution of setting the image src attribute to '#' as a temporary placeholder, before being filled with the result image at the end of the quiz. This seemed to work, and cleared the error all together.

- A similar issue cropped up regarding some of the empty heading content:

![W3C HTML Validator empty heading issue](docs/w3c/w3c-html-empty-heading-warning.png)

- I tackled this issue again by placing '#' as placeholders. However this caused them to appear beneath the quiz questions. I ammended this as well by targeting their ID's in style.css, and setting their display to none. I then set their display to block within the showResults function, to ensure these are displayed once the quiz results are displayed.

### Testing User Stories

#### First Time Visitors

*I want to visit South Wales for the first time and don't know where to start looking.*

- Discover South Wales provides an easily accessible website that addresses the users wants directly on the home page. The headings are clear and to the point, asking the user directly if they are visiting for the first time and if they are ready to start exploring. The quiz button and tagline are obvious enough to the user to take part in to help them find a suited location.

![Home page](docs/images/home-page.png)

*I want to be able to find other places to explore in South Wales if I want more recommendations.*

- The website offers a Map page which gives the user access to Google Maps with 11 markers of all possible results generated from the quiz. The markers provide the name of the location, and access to an external page if the user wants to find out more.

*I want to be able to access additional information on the locations offered.*

- As well as having map markers that when clicked on, navigate the user to an external information page, the user can access these after taking the quiz and getting a suggestion result.

*I want to be able to navigate through the website with ease and efficiency.*

- On desktop and tablet, the navigation links are displayed clearly, separated by two dots. Each page has direct instructions, prompting the user to access certain information. Each button has a matching style element, with clear and concise instructions within. Font awesome icons are used where appropriate and are familiar to a user on what they do.

#### Returning Visitors

*I want to be able to share my experiences with other users by following the website's Instagram page.*

- Across all pages, the footer displays an instagram icon, with accompanying text telling the user to connect and share.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

*I want to be able to see other recommendations pop up from time to time, so that I can continue exploring South Wales and share this with others.*

- As mentioned in future implementations, I want to be able to create a working instagram page which encourages users to share images of where they have been and tagging Discover Wales' within.
- The Map page will host additional markers with other places to go, potentially replacing some old ones that pop up the least when users take the quiz.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse in Chrome Developer tools so I could test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

**Home Page - Desktop:**

**Home Page - Mobile:**

I was very pleased with my lighthouse results for the home page on both desktop and mobile.

**Quiz Page - Desktop:**

After my initial lighthouse testing for the quiz page I wanted to improve accessibiity to achieve a top score of 100 and found the following issue:

![Lighthouse accessibility issue for quiz page, desktop](docs/lighthouse/lighthouse-quiz-accessibility-issue.png)

By ammending the h4 heading in the footer to a h3 element in the quiz page, so that the heading elements were all in a sequentially descending order, this resolved the issue. See final lighthouse below:

**Quiz Page - Mobile:**

I was happy with the mobile lighthouse results for the quiz page. There was definitely room for improvement with performance, but as this was in the green, I felt that I could revisit this another time.
